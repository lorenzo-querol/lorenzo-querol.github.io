Hi, I'm Lorenzo. I'm a graduate of De La Salle University Manila, with a B.Sc. degree in Computer Science, major in Computer Systems Engineering. 

I'll be entering the master's program in Information Science at [Osaka University's Graduate School of Information Science and Technology](https://www.ist.osaka-u.ac.jp/english/) starting October this year.  

My research interests include Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

During my free time, I enjoy studying Japanese, exercising, playing games, watching anime, and learning different recipes to cook.
