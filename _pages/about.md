Hi, I'm Lorenzo. I'm a graduate of De La Salle University Manila, with a B.Sc. degree in Computer Science, major in Computer Systems Engineering. 

I'm currently applying for graduate school, with a goal of pursuing a Master's degree and Ph.D. Degree in Computer Science at [Osaka University's Graduate School of Information Science and Technology](https://www.ist.osaka-u.ac.jp/english/). 

My research interests include Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

 During my free time, I enjoy studying Japanese, exercising, playing games, watching anime, and learning different recipes to cook.
